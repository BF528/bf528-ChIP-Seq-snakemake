Use this notebook to quickly write the methods for the week:

DeepTools `compute_matrix` was used to generate matrices of scores of peaks that fall into +/- 2kb regions  of interest defined by the HG38 annotation file using flags (-b 2000 -a 2000).
DeepTools `plotProfile` was used to generate visualizations for both RUNX1 replicates showing signal coverage averaged across the body of all genes.
We combined differnetiall expressed genes identified via RNA-Seq analyses using DESeq2 with annotated peaks generated by HOMER to create figure 2F. 



If asked, you may also include any plots or figures in this notebook as well:
