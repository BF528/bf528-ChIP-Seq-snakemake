Use this notebook to quickly write the methods for the week:

Bowtie2 (ref) was used to generate an index for the human genome reference (GRCh38).  
Post trimmomatic raw reads were aligned to the reference using Bowtie2.
Samtools flagstat (ref) was used to check for alignment quality, and MultiQC (ref) was used to generate an overall quality report combining samtools flagstat and FastQC reports
Sorted and indexed BAM's generated from the alignment were converted into bigwig files to generate a clustered Heatmap for the four samples.




If asked, you may also include any plots or figures in this notebook as well:
